## Condition I got it in
- Missing controller,
- Chipped-off piece of 3-bolt X-axis ball screw mounting section under the table,
- Spindle motor taken off,
- All motor wires were cut-off (presumably when the controller was removed),
- Bent shaft on the X-axis motor,
- Missing timing belt on the X-axis motor,
- Misaligned (knocked off) case of the Z-axis motor,
